A simple password generator used primarily to practice test driven development on a simple react project with React Testing Library.

Design is based on Frontend Mentor's [Password generator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh) app.

# Build and run

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run startup script
